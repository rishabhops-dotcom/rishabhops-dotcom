# 👋 Hey there, I'm Arifulla Shaik!

🚀 **DevOps Engineer** | Azure| AWS | Terraform |VMWare|  Azure Devops| Github Actions | Jenkins | Docker | Kubernetes | CI/CD | Linux

🌱 I'm currently sharpening my skills by building hands-on DevOps labs and real-world infrastructure automation projects on AZure and AWS.

### 🧠 What I’m focusing on:
- 🔧 Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform**
- 🌀 CI/CD pipelines with **Azure Devops & GitHub Actions**
- ☁️ Cloud provisioning on **Azure** – VMs, VNet, Storta, IAM
- 🐳 Containerization using **Docker**
- ☸️ Orchestration with **Kubernetes AKS & EKS & Kubeadm**
- 📦 Automating deployments using **Ansible & Bash scripting**
